DESIGN:
We primarily followed the design provided in the starter code, though we implemented various helper functions. 
For example, in game.cpp, we implemented the methods can_move_here and can_block to help us test for various 
edge cases in checkmate. Additionally, we also implemented methods such as left_col_in_check, right_col_in_check 
etc... to check if the king can move to adjacent rows and columns. These helper functions were called in the 
method in_check.

Point value implementation:
We have two methods: white_point_value and black_point_value. white_point_value checks every white piece on
the board and adds the points to point_value. black_point_value works in a similar fashion.

COMPLETE:
