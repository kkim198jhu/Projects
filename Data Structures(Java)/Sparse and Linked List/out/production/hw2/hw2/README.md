We should use ArrayIndexList as it is an array that can easily access the known variable
within find. It can easily access the middle within binary search instead of having to iterate throughout the entire list like its 
counterparts such as Linked List and Sparse Linked List. If we are finding more than adding/removing, we should use ArrayIndexList. 
Also, since all the email's will be different, the point of having a sparse list is useless as there would be no default value
that we can use.
